# parsing-html

The parsing-HTML tool is a Bash script that extracts specific data from HTML documents. It processes the HTML content, searches for particular elements or attributes, and then extracts and formats the desired information. The tool uses command-line utilities like curl, grep, sed, and awk to navigate the HTML structure and cleanly output the results, making it ideal for tasks like web scraping or automated content extraction.
